PRIVMSG #42 :1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
PRIVMSG #42 :the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
PRIVMSG #42 :waters.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
PRIVMSG #42 :from the darkness.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
PRIVMSG #42 :And the evening and the morning were the first day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
PRIVMSG #42 :and let it divide the waters from the waters.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
PRIVMSG #42 :under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
PRIVMSG #42 :and it was so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
PRIVMSG #42 :morning were the second day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
PRIVMSG #42 :unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
PRIVMSG #42 :the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
PRIVMSG #42 :seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
PRIVMSG #42 :in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
PRIVMSG #42 :his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
PRIVMSG #42 :his kind: and God saw that it was good.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
PRIVMSG #42 :to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
PRIVMSG #42 :seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in
PRIVMSG #42 :the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
PRIVMSG #42 :so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
PRIVMSG #42 :and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
PRIVMSG #42 :upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and
PRIVMSG #42 :to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
PRIVMSG #42 :creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
PRIVMSG #42 :open firmament of heaven.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
PRIVMSG #42 :moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
PRIVMSG #42 :and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
PRIVMSG #42 :the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
PRIVMSG #42 :his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
PRIVMSG #42 :kind: and it was so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
PRIVMSG #42 :after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
PRIVMSG #42 :his kind: and God saw that it was good.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
PRIVMSG #42 :and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
PRIVMSG #42 :of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
PRIVMSG #42 :every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
PRIVMSG #42 :he him; male and female created he them.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
PRIVMSG #42 :multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
PRIVMSG #42 :over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
PRIVMSG #42 :living thing that moveth upon the earth.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
PRIVMSG #42 :which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
PRIVMSG #42 :is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
PRIVMSG #42 :and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
PRIVMSG #42 :life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
PRIVMSG #42 :very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
PRIVMSG #42 :
PRIVMSG #42 :2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
PRIVMSG #42 :them.
PRIVMSG #42 :
